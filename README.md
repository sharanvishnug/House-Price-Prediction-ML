An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts house prices using the **King County House Sales Dataset**. The project covers the complete ML lifecycle—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, explainability with SHAP, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

# 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to accurately predict house prices based on property characteristics such as:

- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Living Area
- Lot Size
- Grade
- View
- Waterfront
- Location
- Construction Year
- Renovation Details
- and many more...

The project follows industry-standard Machine Learning practices including:

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Comparison
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Cross Validation
- Model Explainability (SHAP)
- Streamlit Deployment
